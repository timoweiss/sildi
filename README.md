# SilDi - Silentdisco

It streams pcm chunks from the browser's mic to the node server through websockets.

    git clone git@github.com:timoweiss/sildi.git

    npm install

To start run:

    npm start

Then go to `http://localhost:3700`, accept the access for the mic and have a look at the Terminal.

The implementation is highly inspired by [https://github.com/gabrielpoca/browser-pcm-stream](https://github.com/gabrielpoca/browser-pcm-stream)
